# Identified Issues and Solutions

1. **Security Issues:**
   - Hardcoded credentials in EmailService
   - Database credentials in plain text properties file
   
2. **Resource Management:**
   - Potential connection leaks in database operations
   - No proper connection pool shutdown handling
   
3. **Dependency Injection:**
   - Manual instantiation of dependencies in AppointmentService
   - Poor service lifecycle management
   
4. **Exception Handling:**
   - Inadequate error handling in appointment operations
   - SQL exceptions not properly managed

5. **Code Structure:**
   - Improper generic type usage in AppointmentService
   - Inconsistent service initialization

## Implementation Plan:

1. Fix dependency injection using ServiceFactory properly
2. Move credentials to secure configuration
3. Implement proper resource management
4. Enhance error handling
5. Fix service initialization
6. Implement proper connection pool management
