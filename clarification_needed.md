## Clarification Needed

I notice that your project appears to be a Veterinary Clinic Management System with various services including:
- Appointment management
- Client management
- Pet management
- Resource management
- Vaccine stock management

However, the request to "add the codes to my project" is too vague to properly assist. To help you effectively, please provide more specific details about:

1. What specific code or functionality you want to add to the project?
2. Where in the project structure should the code be added?
3. What problem or requirement are you trying to address?
4. Are there any specific features or improvements you're looking to implement?

Some examples of more specific requests might be:
- "Add code to implement email notifications for appointment reminders"
- "Add validation for pet vaccination records"
- "Implement a new feature to track pet medications"
- "Add reporting functionality for monthly appointment statistics"

Please provide additional details so I can assist you properly with your project.
